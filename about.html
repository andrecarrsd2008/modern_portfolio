        <h3>Several years ago I had the opportunity to work in a tech room at a local charter school. It was there
          I discovered what "code" was and how it worked. Watching the students learn how to code became
          quite intriguing. It was something new, watching them in the classroom made me interested
          in learning how to become a programmer. Fast forward several years, to start my career, I signed up for a 
          <i>coding boot camp</i> so I can one day become a web developer.</h3>
